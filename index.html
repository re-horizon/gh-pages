       <h1 id="about">About Us</h1>
        <p>WB Horizon Real Estate LLC is an owner-managed company focused on buying and selling vacant land around metropolitan areas in the US. We serve highly-satisfied customers from both, the selling side as well as the buying side.</p><p>Many of our customers from the selling side were glad to have cash rather than the burden of property ownership. Many of them had plans for their property when they initially purchased it, but with time these plans changed. That is where we can help. Our team of research experts identifies vacant land that we can quickly sell through our broad customer base and various sales channels. That means fast cash for you! And it is also simple. In most of our transactions we cover all costs for the seller. We also reduced the paperwork to a minimum. The rest will be handled by well-known title companies.</p><p>And many of our customers from the buying side were very happy to get their dream property very fast to a very fair price. Our great value deals enable us to sell land much faster than our competitors. And we all know: time is money: Decide today and the property is yours, decide tomorrow and you might already be too late. But rest assured: All our transactions will be executed by well-known title companies.</p><p>Regardless of whether you are a seller or a buyer, we always strive to deliver an outstanding customer experience. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to contact us from Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm (CST) at (302) 3308157 (toll free). <br>We look forward to doing business with you!</p>
